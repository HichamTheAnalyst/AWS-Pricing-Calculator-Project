# 📊 AWS Pricing Calculator Project

## 📝 Project Summary
This project involves creating a cost estimate for an AWS architecture that uses a **variable number of Amazon EC2 instances** based on peak usage times. It focuses on practicing pricing configuration, grouping resources logically, and modifying instances for cost optimization.

## 🚀 Goals
- Configure an AWS **price estimate** using the AWS Pricing Calculator.
- Create **logical pricing groups** for better resource management.
- Estimate **Amazon EC2 usage** based on scaling during peak periods.
- **Change the EC2 instance type** from the original family to a **t2.micro** for cost efficiency.
- **Generate and share a new price estimate URL** after modifications.

## ⚙️ Tasks Completed
- Created logical groups for EC2 resources.
- Built an initial price estimate for variable EC2 usage.
- Updated the EC2 instance type to **t2.micro**.
- Generated a **new, shareable pricing URL** for validation.
- Ensured the estimate meets AWS Cloud DIY goals.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **AWS Pricing Calculator**
- **AWS Cloud Concepts**

## 📎 Outcome
A validated cost-optimized AWS estimate that reflects proper instance sizing practices, which is critical for cloud cost management and architecture planning.
